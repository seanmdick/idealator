# Workshop 2 Baseline project #
## Lessons learned so far ##
* apparently rails 3 whitelists xhr requests, no need for that extending the xhr to include the anti-forgery token
* jasmine works with rails 3, but needs some love to get it up and running

## Things still to do ##
* make a template to include jasmine
* add jquery js rails replacement in template
* make it look nicer (get a designer to donate some time)
* write specs
* write devchix wiki curriculum
